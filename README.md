# MINESWEEPER
Welcome to Minesweeper, the classic logic-based puzzle game where your goal is to clear the minefield without detonating any mines! Minesweeper is a game of strategy and deduction. Your mission is to uncover all the squares on the grid that do not contain mines, while avoiding the ones that do. Each square you uncover will reveal a number, indicating the number of mines adjacent to that square. Use these clues wisely to determine which squares are safe to uncover and which ones you should flag as mines. Be cautious, though, because if you uncover a square with a mine, the game is over! Are you ready to test your wits and become a Minesweeper master? Let's dive in and start sweeping those mines!
